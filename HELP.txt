Stages
----------------------------------------
Temper contains four distinct stages that all modify the sound output in different
ways. The order of each stage is described here:

Input --> Lowpass Filter --> Saturation --> Phase Distortion --> Feedback --> Output

The parameters that follow each control different aspects of one of the four stages.

Parameters
----------------------------------------
Cutoff: Sets the cutoff frequency of the resonant lowpass filter in the first stage.

Resonance: Sets the corner resonance of the resonant lowpass filter in the first stage.

Curve: The first of the three parameters that control the distortion unit, Curve sets
the shape of the waveshaper curve used to saturate the input signal before the
phase distortion module. At its lowest value, the Curve knob sets a shape that approximates
the identity transformation: that is, no saturation. At its highest value, the curve shape
becomes steep and introduces a lot of harmonic content, particularly odd harmonics.

Drive: Like a traditional overdrive, Temper includes a gain step right before the
waveshaper. Drive determines the gain applied at that step. The negative range of the Drive
knob enables you to invert the polarity of the signal through the waveshaper, which yields
a slightly different modulation effect in the phase distortion stage.

Saturation: The Saturation parameter controls the Dry/Wet mix of the waveshaper
output; at 0.0, the dry input signal goes into the phase distortion module with the
saturated signal controlling the phase modulation. At 1.0, the wet waveshaper signal goes
into the phase distortion module which is modulated by the same wet signal.

Feedback: The signal chain includes a feedback loop, taking the output of the
distortion unit and feeding it back right before the distoriton unit again
(after the filter). The Feedback knob decides the gain multiplier on that feedback loop.

Level: This simply adjusts the output level.
