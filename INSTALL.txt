Installation Instructions
========================================

Installing the Temper plugin is a simple process of copying the correct
plugin version to the appropriate directory on your system. If after you've
copied the plugin files you cannot get your plugin host or DAW to recognize
Temper, please consult your host's documentation, as every host may be different.

Windows
----------------------------------------
To install Temper on Windows, copy the desired plugin version from
the Win/ directory here into the appropriate target directory below.

For 64-bit plugins (Win/Temper (x64).dll and Win/Temper (x64).vst3), 

- C:\Program Files\VstPlugins\

For 32-bit plugins (Win/Temper.dll and Win/Temper.vst3):

- C:\Program Files (x86)\VstPlugins\


This assumes that you are working on a 64-bit computer. Consult the documentation
for your plugin host or DAW to identify whether it supports 64-bit plugins or
only 32-bit plugins. Trying to load the 64-bit version of Temper in a plugin host
that only supports 32-bit plugins will cause an error.

OSX
----------------------------------------
To install Temper on OSX, copy the desired plugin version from the OSX/ directory
here into one of the following installation directories.

For VST (OSX/Temper.vst):

- /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST/                   (Preferred)
- ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST/

For VST3 (OSX/Temper.vst3):

- /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/

For AU (OSX/Temper.component):

- /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/            (Preferred)
- ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/


If you have any trouble, please consult the documentation for your plugin
host or DAW. We are always happy to help if you need, please email nick@creativeintent.co
to get in touch.
