# Temper

> Modern digital distortion. 

Temper is a digital distortion audio plugin targeting VST, VST3, AU, and AUv3
for OS X and Windows. It builds upon traditional waveshaping techniques using
modulated filter coefficients to produce a unique phase distortion. The primary
signal processing loop is written with Faust, and compiled with JUCE for the
various build targets.
